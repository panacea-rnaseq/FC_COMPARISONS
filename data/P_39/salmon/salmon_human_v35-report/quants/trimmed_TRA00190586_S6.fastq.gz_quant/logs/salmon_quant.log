[2020-11-11 13:23:24.681] [jointLog] [info] Counted 10998092 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 13:23:24.767] [jointLog] [warning] 0.162272% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
