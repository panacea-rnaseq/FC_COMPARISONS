==================
Observed 11785991 total fragments (11785991 in most recent round)

[2020-11-11 13:03:38.684] [jointLog] [warning] 0.174835% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
