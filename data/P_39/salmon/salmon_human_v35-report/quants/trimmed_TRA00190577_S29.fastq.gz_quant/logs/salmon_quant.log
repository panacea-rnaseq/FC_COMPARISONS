[2020-11-11 13:19:45.227] [jointLog] [info] Counted 9082406 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 13:19:45.293] [jointLog] [warning] 0.199049% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
