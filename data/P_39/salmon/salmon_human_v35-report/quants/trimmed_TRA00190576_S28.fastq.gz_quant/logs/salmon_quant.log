[2020-11-11 13:15:48.548] [jointLog] [info] Computed 282429 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-11-11 13:15:48.548] [jointLog] [info] Counted 11101382 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 13:15:48.643] [jointLog] [warning] 0.165824% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
