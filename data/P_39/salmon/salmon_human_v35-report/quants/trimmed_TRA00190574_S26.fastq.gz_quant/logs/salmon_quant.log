[2020-11-11 13:07:43.910] [jointLog] [info] Counted 16752527 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 13:07:44.014] [jointLog] [warning] 0.170953% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
