[2020-11-11 12:46:52.097] [jointLog] [info] Computed 285965 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-11-11 12:46:52.097] [jointLog] [info] Counted 11795440 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 12:46:52.208] [jointLog] [warning] 0.176796% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
