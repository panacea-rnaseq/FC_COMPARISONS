[2020-11-11 12:34:55.447] [jointLog] [info] Computed 298343 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-11-11 12:34:55.447] [jointLog] [info] Counted 12870490 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 12:34:55.545] [jointLog] [warning] 0.166645% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
