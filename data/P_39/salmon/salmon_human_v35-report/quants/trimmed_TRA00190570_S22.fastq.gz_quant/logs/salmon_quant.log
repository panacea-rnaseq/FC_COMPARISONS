[2020-11-11 12:51:07.487] [jointLog] [info] Counted 16975720 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 12:51:07.597] [jointLog] [warning] 0.175417% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
