[2020-11-11 13:11:49.046] [jointLog] [info] Counted 10353023 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 13:11:49.123] [jointLog] [warning] 0.171048% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
