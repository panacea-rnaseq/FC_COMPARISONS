[2020-11-11 12:55:19.770] [jointLog] [info] Computed 277281 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-11-11 12:55:19.770] [jointLog] [info] Counted 9770109 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 12:55:19.853] [jointLog] [warning] 0.188208% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
