[2020-11-11 12:38:59.505] [jointLog] [info] Computed 286638 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-11-11 12:38:59.505] [jointLog] [info] Counted 11826401 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 12:38:59.585] [jointLog] [warning] 0.176303% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
