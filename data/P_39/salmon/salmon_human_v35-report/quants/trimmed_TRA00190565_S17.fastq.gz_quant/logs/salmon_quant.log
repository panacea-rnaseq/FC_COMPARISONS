[2020-11-11 12:30:54.522] [jointLog] [info] Counted 10544382 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-11-11 12:30:54.616] [jointLog] [warning] 0.162909% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
