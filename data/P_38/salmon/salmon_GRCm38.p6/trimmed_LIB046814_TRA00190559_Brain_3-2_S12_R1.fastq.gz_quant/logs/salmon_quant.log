[2020-10-27 15:23:56.723] [jointLog] [info] Computed 208385 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-10-27 15:23:56.723] [jointLog] [info] Counted 20400653 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:23:56.778] [jointLog] [warning] 0.187842% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
