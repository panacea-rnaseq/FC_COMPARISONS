[2020-10-27 15:39:53.851] [jointLog] [info] Computed 179289 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-10-27 15:39:53.851] [jointLog] [info] Counted 16109896 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:39:53.907] [jointLog] [warning] 0.16169% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
