[2020-10-27 14:56:50.235] [jointLog] [info] Counted 11964484 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 14:56:50.274] [jointLog] [warning] 0.150386% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
