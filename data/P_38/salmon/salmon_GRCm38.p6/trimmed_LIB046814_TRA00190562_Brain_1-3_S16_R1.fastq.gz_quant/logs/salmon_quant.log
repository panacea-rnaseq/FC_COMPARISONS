[2020-10-27 15:35:59.617] [jointLog] [info] Counted 20044277 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:35:59.670] [jointLog] [warning] 0.161121% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
