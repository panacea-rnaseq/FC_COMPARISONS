[2020-10-27 14:59:55.133] [jointLog] [info] Computed 179071 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-10-27 14:59:55.133] [jointLog] [info] Counted 10556447 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 14:59:55.171] [jointLog] [warning] 0.16362% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
