[2020-10-27 15:43:29.479] [jointLog] [info] Computed 179086 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-10-27 15:43:29.479] [jointLog] [info] Counted 11979908 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:43:29.523] [jointLog] [warning] 0.165088% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
