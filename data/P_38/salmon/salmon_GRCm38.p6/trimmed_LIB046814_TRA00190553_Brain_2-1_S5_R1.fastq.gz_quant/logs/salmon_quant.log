[2020-10-27 15:03:23.121] [jointLog] [info] Computed 174259 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-10-27 15:03:23.121] [jointLog] [info] Counted 12631435 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:03:23.166] [jointLog] [warning] 0.15606% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
