[2020-10-27 15:31:47.131] [jointLog] [info] Computed 226218 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-10-27 15:31:47.131] [jointLog] [info] Counted 22611424 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:31:47.205] [jointLog] [warning] 0.168831% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
