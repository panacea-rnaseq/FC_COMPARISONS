[2020-10-27 15:09:51.536] [jointLog] [info] Computed 164059 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-10-27 15:09:51.536] [jointLog] [info] Counted 8549459 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:09:51.570] [jointLog] [warning] 0.186184% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
