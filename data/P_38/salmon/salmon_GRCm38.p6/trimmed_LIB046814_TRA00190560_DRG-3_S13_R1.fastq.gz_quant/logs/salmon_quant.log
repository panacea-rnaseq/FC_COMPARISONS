[2020-10-27 15:27:47.351] [jointLog] [info] Counted 14335156 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:27:47.415] [jointLog] [warning] 0.173776% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
