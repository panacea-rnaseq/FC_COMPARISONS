[2020-10-27 15:16:33.114] [jointLog] [info] Counted 10735745 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:16:33.152] [jointLog] [warning] 0.173556% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
