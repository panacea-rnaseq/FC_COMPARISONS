==================
Observed 40162880 total fragments (40162880 in most recent round)

[2020-10-27 14:49:07.782] [jointLog] [warning] 0.1683% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
