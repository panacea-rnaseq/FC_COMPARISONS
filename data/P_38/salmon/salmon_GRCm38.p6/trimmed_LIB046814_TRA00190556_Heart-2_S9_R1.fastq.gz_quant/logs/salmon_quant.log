[2020-10-27 15:13:15.402] [jointLog] [info] Counted 11347331 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:13:15.440] [jointLog] [warning] 0.17082% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
