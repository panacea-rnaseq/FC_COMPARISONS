Observed 5503355 total fragments (5503355 in most recent round)

[2020-10-27 15:46:44.153] [jointLog] [info] Computed 142981 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-10-27 15:46:44.153] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4934211 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:46:44.177] [jointLog] [warning] 0.172113% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.


[2020-10-27 15:46:44.190] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4934211 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
