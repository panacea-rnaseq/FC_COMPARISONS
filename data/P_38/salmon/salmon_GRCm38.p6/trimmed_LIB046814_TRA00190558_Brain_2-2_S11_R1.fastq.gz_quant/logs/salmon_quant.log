Observed 17698960 total fragments (17698960 in most recent round)

[2020-10-27 15:20:07.796] [jointLog] [info] Computed 177695 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-10-27 15:20:07.796] [jointLog] [info] Counted 16585301 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-10-27 15:20:07.878] [jointLog] [warning] 0.169451% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
